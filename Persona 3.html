            <p>The story of Persona 3 has a very obvious, but very strong theme about death and the meaning of life. though out most of the story, the main Charecters all deal with human loss in some way, or wonder what is the meaning of life. this is argubly the most powerful the 3 games because no one can avoid death even if they wanted to, plus even with the rate of suicides increase every year, many people belive there is no point to life. but there is a point to living. its about being with others and leaving and impact on them. you know your life shapes to future of many people today, no matter what job you have, and no matter how small they seem. </p>
