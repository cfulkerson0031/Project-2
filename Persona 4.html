            <p>Persona 4 is a murder mystey in a small town and to do so, our main charcters must see thourgh the lies and falsehoods that are all around to them, many times our charcters or the public are shown some thing that seems like the truth or feels like the right path to end the case. but by putting the picecs together, They learn this murder mystery isn't un-Bear-able. Not every truth is great. They also need to uncoverthe the dark truths within their friends of what they see in each other and face the dark side of themselves, which I'm sure everyone can relate to in some way, shape or form. Normally this would be done via breaking the bad habit or understanding the consequenses of their actions. Here it's about understanding it and accepting those flaws and that other part of you as who you really are, Which is an interesting way of going about character development, rather than getting rid of a flaw, you understand and embrace your flaw.</p>
