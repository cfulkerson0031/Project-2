    <p>Over the past few years, I have had the pleasure of playing thourgh Persona 3 4 & 5 with each game changing my life for the better, With one of them being my favorite game of all time. each one containing themes that resonate with a lot of people even to this day. In face in todays modern age, we need these now more than ever. I want to make this website to go over these themes and the mythology surrounding all three of these titles. I'm going to try to keep spoilers to the most minimum I could be, because I really want people to play these games. I will avoid Characters/names, Plot points to the best of my ablity, Gameplay, etc</p>
